CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review. You are provided with a publication's title and abstract extracted from PubMed or Semantic Scholar, in which use or analysis of patient/medical registry was proven. 
Register and registry are synonyms.


TASK and DEFINITIONS:
Extract the following fields from the publication's title and abstract (as Text_to_analyze):
- Population description: refers to the group of individuals or subjects that researchers target for inclusion in the study based on specific criteria. This group is chosen to represent the larger body of people to whom the results will be applicable. 
Then given the population description, extract the following fields:
- Population sex: Population sex of the population included. You are only strictly allowed to use classes among: "Male", "Female".
- Population age group: Age of the population included. You are only strictly allowed to use classes among: "Child", "Adult", "Older Adult".
- Population size: Size of the population considered in the study. 
    * If you cannot find the exact number, you can use uses orders of magnitude to the power of 10 (e.g., ~10, ~100, ~1000, ~10000, etc.). If you cannot find any number, write "Not found".
- Population follow-up: Duration of the study. 
    * If you have only start date without end date (respectively only end date without start date), write "<start date> to [End date not found]" (respectively "[Start date not found] to <end date>"). 
    * If cannot find the exact duration, you can use orders of magnitude like this (e.g., ~1 month, ~3 months, ~6 months, ~1 year, ~2 years, ~5 years, >10 years). 
    * You can also use your own knowledge of the used registry (or other famous databases) to estimate the duration, if you are sure about it.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
These extractions will later be integrated in a database, then displayed in box on a screen of a website that will help clinicians explore registries and how they were used in previous studies. This goal will help them identify the right registry for their research or clinical needs.
The publication you are given can thus be of different types, such as observational studies, clinical trials, or reviews, as long as they involve the use of a patient registry. Thus some fields may not be applicable to all publications. In this case, first try to extract something that is still related to the field (as long as it is related to the field, and useful for clinicians), and if not applicable, write "Not found".

OUTPUT FORMAT of your answer:
{
    "Population description": STRING,
    "Population sex": STRING,
    "Population age group": STRING,
    "Population size": STRING,
    "Population follow-up": STRING    
}


Constraints:
- If the information is not available, write only "Not found"
- Be synthetic when answering
- Do not add anything in addition to the proposed JSON output format

MAIN EXAMPLE:
INFORMATION IN TEXT_TO_ANALYZE:
"Using the Veterans Health Administration cancer registry, we evaluated treatment patterns in elderly male patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who initiated first-line chemotherapy after January 2005. A few thousand cases were identified, and follow-up is ongoing."
- BAD:
    * extractions:
        {
            "Population description": "Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer",
            "Population sex": "Not found",
            "Population age group": "Adult",
            "Population size": "Not found",
            "Population follow-up": "Not found"
        }
    * why?: Sex and age group are mis-classified or missing, size and follow-up are ignored despite being hinted (“male”, “elderly”, “few thousand”, and start date).

- GOOD:
    * extractions:
        {
            "Population description": "Elderly male patients with metastatic colorectal cancer initiating first-line chemotherapy",
            "Population sex": "Male",
            "Population age group": "Older Adult",
            "Population size": "~1000",
            "Population follow-up": "January 2005 to [End date not found]"
        }
    * why?: 
        - Population description: Includes key qualifiers—elderly, male, metastatic colorectal cancer, and treatment context.
        - Population sex: “male patients” explicitly stated → Male.
        - Population age group: “elderly” maps to Older Adult per definition.
        - Population size: “a few thousand” ⇒ order-of-magnitude ~1000 (nearest power of 10).
        - Population follow-up: Only a start date “January 2005” given → format “January 2005 to [End date not found]”.

Example 3:
Text_to_analyze:
"We linked the Korean National Health Insurance Service database with the National Stroke Registry to examine long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke in older adults. The cohort included approximately 85,000 cases discharged in 2012, with a median observation period of 7 years."

    "Population sex": "Not found",
    "Population age group": "Older Adult",
    "Population size": "~100000",
