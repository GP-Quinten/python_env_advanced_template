You are provided with two strings representing the terminologies of medical conditions. Your task is to determine whether these two terminologies refer to the same medical condition or to different medical conditions.
In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.

- Medical condition: The medical condition, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. Medical conditions may also include other health‑related issues, such as lifespan, quality of life, and health risks. Can be a list of conditions separated with a comma.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

<example1>
Medical condition 1: "ACL"
Medical condition 2: "Anterior cruciate ligament"
{
  "explanation": "The use of the acronym 'ACL' and its expanded form indicates that both terminologies refer to the same medical condition.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example1>

<example2>
Medical condition 1: "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)"
Medical condition 2: "Autosomal dominant PKD"
{
  "explanation": "The second term abbreviates the first, omitting 'polycystic kidney disease' but keeping the key components; both denote the same inherited kidney disorder.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example2>

<example3>
Medical condition 1: "Acute ischemic stroke"
Medical condition 2: "Brain infarction caused by sudden arterial occlusion"
{
  "explanation": "A brain infarction from abrupt arterial blockage is the pathophysiological description of an acute ischemic stroke, so the two phrases point to the same condition, though phrased differently.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example3>

<example4>
Medical condition 1: "Primary renal vasculitis (Polyarteritis Nodosa, Churg‑Strauss Syndrome, Microscopic Polyangiitis, Henoch‑Schonlein Purpura)"
Medical condition 2: "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)"
{
  "explanation": "Both affect the kidneys, but primary renal vasculitides are small‑ to medium‑vessel inflammatory disorders, whereas IgA nephropathy is an immune‑complex glomerulonephritis; they are distinct conditions.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
</example4>

<example5>
Medical condition 1: "Spinal cord injury (SCI), metastatic tumors, primary tumors"
Medical condition 2: "Common cold (viral upper respiratory infection)"
{
  "explanation": "The first string lists severe neurologic or oncologic conditions affecting the spine, while the second refers to a mild respiratory infection; they are obviously unrelated medical conditions.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
</example5>

Medical condition 1: "{{content_a}}"
Medical condition 2: "{{content_b}}"
