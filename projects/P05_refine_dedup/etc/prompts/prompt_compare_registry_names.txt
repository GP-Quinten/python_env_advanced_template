CONTEXT:
You are provided with two strings representing the names of patient medical registries. 

TASK: Your task is to determine whether these two registry names refer to the same registry or to different registries. In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.

DEFINITION:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases that collect standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data on populations defined by diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. They support observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical-outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative studies, and linkage with other data sources.

OUTPUT:
Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning. No more than 30 words.
- "uncertain": A "yes" or "no" indicating if there is uncertainty in your decision.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

ADDITIONAL INFO:
Key Elements to Consider to Determine if Two Registries are the Same:
- Country or region
- Medical field
- Disease studied
- Treatment studied
- Acronym given in parentheses

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
You may encounter situations where there is uncertainty due to inclusion-conflict, meaning that one registry may be a subset of another or they may share some patients but not all. In such cases, you should follow the decision strategy outlined below.
- If you think Registry 1 and registry 2 have patients in common:
  - First You should output "uncertain": "yes"
  - If registry is a strict subset of patients of the other registry:
    - If you think than less than 50% of the patients in registry are in the other registry, and that they are significantly meaningful additional features in this registry compared to the other, then the final decision is "different", and explain why in the "explanation" field.
    - If you think than more than 50% of the patients in registry are in the other registry, then the final decision is "same", and explain why in the "explanation" field.
  - else If you think that registry 1 and registry 2 have a common subset of patients, but neither is a strict subset of the other, then the final decision is "different", and explain why in the "explanation" field.
