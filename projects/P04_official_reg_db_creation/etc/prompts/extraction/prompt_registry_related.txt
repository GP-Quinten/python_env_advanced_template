Context:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases that collect standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data on populations defined by diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. They support observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical-outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative studies, and linkage with other data sources. Administrative registries (e.g., hospital discharge, national cancer, stroke, chronic disease surveillance systems) qualify if they systematically collect patient-level data suitable for clinical or epidemiological analysis. Simple vital-statistics databases (birth/death) do NOT qualify.

Definitions
- Genuine patient registries: Systematic, standardized collection of patient-level data with enrollment and follow-up.
- Non-qualifying sources: Vital-statistics only, simple claims, administrative birth/death registries without longitudinal clinical detail.

Task:
Given a publication’s title and abstract (as Text_to_analyze), classify whether it is “registry related” by following exact JSON output format.

Steps (in order):
1. Identify data sources
   - List all sources mentioned.
   - Label each as “qualifying registry” or “non-qualifying source.”
   - Confirm qualification against the definition above.
2. Assess usage
   - Determine if the study uses or analyzes the registry data (e.g., epidemiological outcomes, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, linkage, registry-based clinical trials).
   - Publications that only reference or recommend registries without data analysis do not qualify.
3. Output
   - Strict JSON, no extra text:
     {
       "step1_reflexion": "<reasoning about sources>",
       "step2_reflexion": "<reasoning about data use>",
       "Registry related": "yes" | "no"
     }
   - “yes” if the study explicitly analyzes registry data; otherwise “no”.

Key Criteria for “yes”:
- Uses patient-level registry or qualifying administrative data.
- Performs epidemiological, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, or linkage analyses.
- Describes registry-based clinical trials.

Key Criteria for “no”:
- Pure RCTs without registry involvement.
- Cohorts based only on institutional records without standardized registry protocols.
- Studies using vital-statistics only.
- Surveys or opinion pieces without actual registry data analysis.
- Publications merely recommending registries.

Output only the JSON. Do not add explanations.
