Context:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases explicitly designed to collect standardized, longitudinal patient-level data from defined populations characterized by a common disease, condition, exposure, or treatment. Registries support observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessment, and comparative studies. They typically feature structured, ongoing data collection following specific protocols, enabling robust real-world evidence generation.

Classify publications clearly and explicitly as follows:

**Registry related: yes** if the study explicitly describes or uses:
- Patient registry data to perform epidemiological, survival, outcomes, or descriptive analyses.
- A patient registry explicitly named, characterized, or detailed in methods.
- Evaluation of registry data quality, completeness, or validity.
- Comparative analyses explicitly involving multiple patient registries.
- Registry data linked or integrated with other data sources (clinical trials, administrative claims, electronic health records, genetic databases, biobanks).
- Registry-based clinical trials or interventional studies embedded within registry infrastructure (clearly stated).

**Registry related: no** for studies explicitly described as:
- Pure randomized clinical trials without explicit mention of registry-based design or use of registry data.
- General longitudinal or observational cohort studies that do not explicitly involve data from structured patient registries.
- Studies exclusively utilizing administrative databases such as hospitalization records, death certificates (cause-of-death registries), pharmacy/prescription databases, or claims datasets, without reference to structured patient registry systems.
- Studies using retrospective audits or cohorts derived solely from hospital or institutional records without standardized registry-based data collection procedures.
- Studies using assessment tools, questionnaires, or clinical batteries developed by registries (e.g., neuropsychological tests from CERAD) without explicitly analyzing actual registry-collected patient data.
- Clinician or expert opinion surveys that discuss or recommend establishment of registries without actual use or analysis of existing patient registry datasets.
- Publications that merely recommend establishing registries or discuss the potential value of registries without actual registry data use.
- Publications that briefly reference a registry in the background or discussion section without conducting explicit analyses based on data derived from such a registry.

Careful consideration of tricky edge cases encountered previously:
- Mentioning a registry name or acronym (e.g., CERAD) does not automatically imply registry-related classification if only assessment tools or clinical batteries from such registry are used without analyzing patient-level data from the registry.
- Linkage to administrative registries (mortality or hospitalization records) is not sufficient to classify as registry-related unless the data originates from a structured patient registry explicitly defined as such.
- Studies recommending the establishment or enhancement of registries but without actual analysis of existing registry data are not registry-related.
- Surveys or audits derived from clinical records or clinician opinions without explicit use of registry-based patient-level data should be classified as not registry-related.
