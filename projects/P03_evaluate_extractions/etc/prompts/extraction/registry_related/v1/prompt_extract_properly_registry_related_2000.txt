Context:  
Patient registries are structured, observational data collection systems designed explicitly to systematically collect standardized data about groups of patients sharing specific characteristics such as a disease, medical condition, treatment, intervention, or exposure. Registries typically have broad inclusion criteria and long-term, often indefinite, follow-up periods. The primary purpose of patient registries includes epidemiological descriptions, monitoring disease prevalence/incidence, quality assessment, outcomes evaluation, tracking disease trends over time, generating hypotheses, and assessing healthcare quality.

You must identify whether the provided text (Title + Abstract) is related to a patient registry explicitly or implicitly by classifying as follows:

Classify as "Registry related: yes" if the text describes at least one of these cases explicitly or implicitly:
- Direct description or characterization of a specific patient registry (e.g., national disease registry, population registry, treatment-specific registry).
- Use of patient registry data, partially or fully, to perform epidemiological studies, outcomes analyses, or disease prevalence/incidence analyses.
- Descriptive epidemiology studies analyzing data quality, completeness, trends, or outcomes from a patient registry.
- Studies comparing two or more patient registries explicitly.
- Studies explicitly linking or merging patient registry data with other healthcare data sources (claims, EHR, biobanks, genetic databases, cohorts).
- Registry-based clinical trials, explicitly mentioning interventional or randomized components embedded within patient registries.

Classify as "Registry related: no" if the text describes one of these cases:
- Purely interventional clinical trials (unless explicitly mentioned as registry-based clinical trials).
- General observational or longitudinal cohort studies not explicitly involving or mentioning patient registries.
- Studies primarily using general real-world data sources (electronic health records, claims databases, administrative databases, or wearable devices) without clearly indicating registry-specific data involvement.
- Studies focusing exclusively on healthcare databases or administrative data sets without reference to systematic data collection through registries.

Carefully consider edge cases:
- If a study explicitly mentions using registry data as the primary or partial source of data for observational or descriptive purposes, classify as yes.
- Studies mentioning "registry" in a generic or administrative sense, without describing systematic patient data collection, should be classified as no.
- Studies explicitly evaluating registry data quality, linkage, or comparative analyses must always be classified as yes.

Your output must strictly follow this JSON format without additional explanations or justifications:
{
    "Registry related": "yes" or "no"
}

Do not include any other text, explanation, comments or formatting outside of this exact JSON structure.
