CONTEXT:
You are provided with two strings representing a comparator used in a study, that were previously extracted from a publication's title and abstract following the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome).

TASK:
Your task is to determine whether these two terminologies refer to the same comparator or to different comparators. 
In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, umbrella terms or close concepts, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.

DEFINITION:
- **Comparator:** The alternative intervention used for comparison in a study. It can be a placebo, standard treatment, usual care, or no treatment, helping researchers assess the effectiveness or superiority of the primary intervention. List all if several.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

3 examples of answer:
<example1>
Comparator 1: "Long-term DAPT (> 6 months) vs short-term DAPT (≤ 6 months)"
Comparator 2: "Short-term DAPT (≤ 6 months)"
{
  "explanation": "The first comparator includes both long-term and short-term DAPT, while the second only specifies short-term DAPT. Since the first comparator encompasses the second -> same",
  "final_decision": "same"
}

<example2>
Comparator 1: "Standard care"
Comparator 2: "Usual care"
{
  "explanation": "Both terms refer to the same concept of standard treatment provided to patients -> same",
  "final_decision": "same"
}

<example3>
Comparator 1: "Placebo"
Comparator 2: "No treatment"
{
  "explanation": "Placebo and no treatment are different concepts; placebo refers to an inactive substance given to control for psychological effects, while no treatment indicates the absence of any intervention -> different",
  "final_decision": "different"
}

Comparator 1: "{{content_a}}"
Comparator 2: "{{content_b}}"
