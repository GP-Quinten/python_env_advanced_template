Context:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases that collect standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data on populations defined by diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. They support observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical-outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative studies, and linkage with other data sources. Administrative registries (e.g., hospital discharge, national cancer, stroke, chronic disease surveillance systems) qualify if they systematically collect patient-level data suitable for clinical or epidemiological analysis. Simple vital-statistics databases (birth/death) do NOT qualify.

Situation:
The publication that is given (title and abstract concatenated as Text_to_analyze) is registry related (it was manually checked), meaning that:
- a least one patient registry is mentioned in the text
- the publication/study uses or analyzes data from that registry

Task:
Given the publication’s title and abstract (as Text_to_analyze), extract as accurately as possible the geographical area of the registry used in the study, or the geographical area of the patients from which data is collected (or list of geographical areas separated by commas) by following the exact JSON output format.

Additional instructions:
- The geographical area is often mentioned in the registry name. 
    * Example: "The French Registry of Patients with Aortic Stenosis" --> Extract 'France' as Geographical area.
- Use your personal knowledge when appropriate and when you are sure of the answer. Especially, you may identify the geographical area based on the name of the registry or the institution that runs it.
    * Example: "Bedside Estimation of Risk From Percutaneous Coronary Interventions: The New Mayo Clinic Risk Scores" --> Extract 'USA' as Geographical area because Mayo Clinic is a famous US organization 
- Determine the most precise location using the hierarchy below (if option 1 is not available, use option 2, etc.):
    1. City (+ Country)
        * Example: "Paris, France"
    2. Region or State (+ Country)
        * Example: "California, USA"
    3. Country
        * Example: "USA"
    4. Multinational / Union of Countries (fewer than 5) (+ List of countries if less than 5)
        * Example: "Multinational - Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden)"
    5. International (More than 5 countries) (+ number of countries if available)
        * Example: "International - Europe"
    6. Worldwide (multiple continents)
        * Example: "Worldwide (5 continents)"
    --> If there is no information towards any of these 6 types of geographical area extractions, assign 'Not found'.

Steps (in order):
1. Extract the registry name (or list of registry names) from the title and abstract, separated by commas.
2. Extract the geographical area, using the title, abstract and registry name that you just extracted at step 1.
3. Output
   - Strict JSON, no extra text:
     {
       "Registry name": "<registry name(s) extracted>",
       "Geographical area": "<geographical area(s) extracted>"
     }

FINAL NOTES:
Output only the JSON. Do not add explanations.
