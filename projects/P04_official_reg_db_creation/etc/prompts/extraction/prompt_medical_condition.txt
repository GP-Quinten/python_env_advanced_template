CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review. You are provided with a publication's title and abstract extracted from PubMed or Semantic Scholar, in which use or analysis of patient/medical registry was proven.
Register and registry are synonyms. 

DEFINITION:
In a clinical study or its publication, a medical condition is typically defined as a specific disease, disorder, health-related state, or procedure (or even environmental/demographic/lifestyle factors) that is the focus of the research and directly characterizes/defines the studied population or cohort

DIFFERENCES.
This is to be distinguished from:
1. Outcome measure / endpoint: Results or effects observed in a study.
2. Risk factors: Characteristics increasing the likelihood of a condition.
3. Main variables / descriptive statistics: Primary factors or data summaries analyzed in a study.
4. Target/study population: The specific group of individuals the study aims to investigate, which may include various medical conditions, demographics, or characteristics.
5. Exposures (treatments or interventions): Medical treatments, interventions, medications, procedures, or environmental factors the study participants receive or encounter.

TASK:
Your task is to extract the most precise medical condition (or combination of medical conditions) that was used to define the studied population, using title and abstract (defined by "Text_to_analyze").
This extraction will be in a small box on a website, so it should be concise and easy to read, among many other publications with similar boxes.
This extraction will be helpul for a clinical researcher to quickly understand what the study is about, what medical condition and what patients are studied.
Keep in mind that Intervention, Comparator, Outcome measure are exctracted in other tasks, so you don't need to extract them here.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Most of the time, the medical condition will be specified in the title. Of course, it can also be specified in the abstract.
2. Distinguish the medical condition from the risk factors, endpoint / outcome measure, main variables / descriptive statistics, and target/study population. 
    * Example: "Patients with Type 2 Diabetes were recruited to study the effects of Metformin on cardiovascular health." 
        - To be extracted: "Type 2 Diabetes" as it is the medical condition defining the study population.
        - Not to be extracted: "Metformin" as it is a treatment (exposure/intervention) rather than a medical condition.
3. Most of the time, you will ave only one medical condition to extract. But in some cases, you may have to extract a combination of medical conditions with the following format.
    * Example: "Breast cancer; Diabetes mellitus type 2" (use semicolon to separate multiple conditions).
4. Output must be concise, ICD-10-style terms. Use Capitalization and semi-colons to separate multiple conditions. 
5. use umbrella terms [+ details] to group close concepts as one medical condition when there are more than one medical condition closely related to each other.
    * Example 1: "Brain Tumors [astrocytoma; glioblastoma; meningioma]" instead of listing each tumor type separately.
    * Example 2: "Organ Transplantation [Liver; Kidney; Heart]"
6. The name of the database(s) / registry(ies) used in the study or in the survey can be a good clue to identify the medical condition, so you can use it in your extraction.


Output format of your answer (no extra text):  
{
    "medical_condition": STRING # The main medical condition(s) defining the study population, in ICD-10 style.
}

EXAMPLES:
1. EXAMPLE 1:
    * Abstract excerpt: "Patients receiving insulin therapy were monitored for diabetic retinopathy progression."
    GOOD:
    {
        "Medical condition": "Diabetes Mellitus [Insulin therapy; Diabetic Retinopathy]"
    }
    * BAD:
    {
        "Medical condition": "Insulin therapy"
    }
2. EXAMPLE 2:
    * Abstract excerpt: "Individuals treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer were recruited to study chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy."
    GOOD:
    {
        "Medical condition": "Breast Cancer"
    }
    * BAD (Intervention instead of Medical condition):
    {
        "Medical condition": "Chemotherapy"
    }
3. EXAMPLE 3:
    * Abstract excerpt: "Patients with elevated LDL cholesterol were followed to assess coronary artery disease development."
    GOOD:
    {
        "Medical condition": "Coronary Artery Disease"
    }
    * BAD (Risk factor instead of Medical condition):
    # Elevated LDL Cholesterol will actually be extracted as a risk factor in another task, not here.
    {
        "Medical condition": "Elevated LDL Cholesterol"
    }
4. EXAMPLE 4:
    * Abstract excerpt: "Smokers over 50 years of age were enrolled to investigate lung cancer incidence."
    GOOD:
    {
        "Medical condition": "Lung Cancer"
    }
    * BAD (Risk factor instead of Medical condition):
    {
        "Medical condition": "Smoking"
    }
5. EXAMPLE 5:
    * Abstract excerpt: "Individuals following a Mediterranean diet were observed for cardiovascular health outcomes."
    GOOD:
    {
        "Medical condition": "Cardiovascular Diseases"
    }
    * BAD (Lifestyle factor instead of Medical condition):
    {
        "Medical condition": "Mediterranean diet"
    }
6. EXAMPLE 6:
    * Abstract excerpt: "Alcohol-dependent individuals were recruited to assess long-term hepatic complications."
    GOOD:
    {
        "Medical condition": "Alcohol Dependence"
    }
    * BAD (Lifestyle factor instead of Medical condition):
    {
        "Medical condition": "Alcohol consumption"
    }

7. EXAMPLE 7:
    * Abstract excerpt: "Patients with lumbar spine disorders were analyzed for treatment outcomes."
    GOOD:
    {
        "medical_condition": "Lumbar Spine Disorders [Disc Herniation, Spinal Stenosis, Degenerative Disc Disease]"
    }
