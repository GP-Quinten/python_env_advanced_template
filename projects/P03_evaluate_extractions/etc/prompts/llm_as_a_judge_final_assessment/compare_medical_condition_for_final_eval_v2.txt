CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review.
You are provided with two strings representing the terminologies of medical conditions previously extracted from a publication's title and abstract.

TASK:
Your task is to determine whether these two terminologies refer to the same medical condition or not.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, umbrella terms, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.
3. If one string/terminology is broader but mainly includes the other, you should consider them as the same.
4. If one string lists multiple items and the other also, and most items globally match, you should consider them as the same.
5. If most of the key concepts found in string n°2 can be found in string n°1, you should consider them as the same. 
6. If more than 50% of the concepts found in string n°2 are missing or different in string n°1, you should consider them as different.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning. It should be synthetic and resums the key points that led you to your decision. Use acronyms to shorten your answer (20 words maximum)
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

<example1>
Medical condition 1: "ACL"
Medical condition 2: "Anterior cruciate ligament"
{
  "explanation": "The use of the acronym 'ACL' and its expanded form indicates that both terminologies refer to the same medical condition.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example1>

<example2> # more tricky example
Medical condition 1: "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)"
Medical condition 2: "Autosomal dominant PKD"
{
  "explanation": "The second term abbreviates the first, omitting 'polycystic kidney disease' but keeping the key components; both denote the same inherited kidney disorder.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example2>

<example3>
Medical condition 1: "Acute ischemic stroke"
Medical condition 2: "Brain infarction caused by sudden arterial occlusion"
{
  "explanation": "A brain infarction from abrupt arterial blockage is the pathophysiological description of an acute ischemic stroke, so the two phrases point to the same condition, though phrased differently.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example3>

<example4>
Medical condition 1: "Primary renal vasculitis (Polyarteritis Nodosa, Churg‑Strauss Syndrome, Microscopic Polyangiitis, Henoch‑Schonlein Purpura)"
Medical condition 2: "IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)"
{
  "explanation": "Both affect the kidneys, but primary renal vasculitides are small‑ to medium‑vessel inflammatory disorders, whereas IgA nephropathy is an immune‑complex glomerulonephritis; they are distinct conditions.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
</example4>

<example5>
Medical condition 1: "Spinal cord injury (SCI), metastatic tumors, primary tumors"
Medical condition 2: "Common cold (viral upper respiratory infection)"
{
  "explanation": "The first string lists severe neurologic or oncologic conditions affecting the spine, while the second refers to a mild respiratory infection; they are obviously unrelated medical conditions.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
</example5>
