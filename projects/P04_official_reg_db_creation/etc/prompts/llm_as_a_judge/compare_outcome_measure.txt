CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review.
You are provided with two strings representing the terminologies of Primary analytic concepts previously extracted from a publication's title and abstract.
If the publication is "Confirmatory", these strings refer to the endpoints used to evaluate the effect of an intervention or exposure in the given clinical study.
If the publication is "Exploratory", these strings refer to the main focus of the study, which could be a risk factor, data-quality / process metric, or descriptive statistics.

TASK:
Your task is to determine whether these two terminologies refer to the same Primary analytic concept or not.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, umbrella terms, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.
2. You will not consider the publication type (Exploratory or Confirmatory) in your decision.
3. If one string/terminology is broader but mainly includes the other, you should consider them as the same.
4. If one string lists multiple items and the other also, and most items globally match, you should consider them as the same.
5. If most of the key concepts found in string n°2 can bee found in string n°1, you should consider them as the same. 
6. If more than 50% of the concepts found in string n°2 are missing or different in string n°1, you should consider them as different.

* Example 1: 
  * String 1: "IR, Median overall survival, MGMT promoter-methylation frequency"
  * String 2: "Incidence rate, Overall survival"
  * Decision: "same" (because most of the key concepts are present in both strings)
* Example 2:
  * String 1: "IR, MGMT promoter-methylation frequency"
  * String 2: "Incidence rate, Overall survival, Tumor size"
  * Decision: "different" (because more than 50% of the key concepts are missing or different in string n°1)

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning. It should be synthetic and resums the key points that led you to your decision. Use acronyms to shorten your answer (20 words maximum)
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

<example1> 
Outcome measure 1: "Ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic events"
Outcome measure 2: "Incidence of ischemic stroke and hemorrhages"
{
  "explanation": "Both phrases describe the same clinical events (ischemic stroke and hemorrhages) and their occurrence",
  "final_decision": "same" }
</example1>

<example2> 
Outcome measure 1: "Body mass index (BMI) and BMI changes over a 2-year period" 
Outcome measure 2: "Change in participants' body mass index across 24 months" 
{
  "explanation": "Both phrases refer to the measurement of body mass index (BMI) and its changes over a 2-year period",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example2>

<example3> 
Outcome measure 1: "Sudden cardiac death (SCD)" 
Outcome measure 2: "Unexpected death attributable to sudden loss of heart function" 
{ 
  "explanation": "Both phrases describe the same clinical event of sudden cardiac death, despite different wording.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example3>

<example4>
Outcome measure 1: "Risks for metachronous advanced adenomas (AAs) and large (&gt;1 cm) serrated polyps"
Outcome measure 2: "Risk of colorectal cancer recurrence within 5 years"
{
  "explanation": "While both relate to colorectal pathology, one measures the future occurrence of specific pre‑cancerous polyps, whereas the other measures recurrence of established colorectal cancer. Both should have been extracted.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
</example4>

<example5>
Outcome measure 1: "Pneumonia occurrence"
Outcome measure 2: "Rate of skin rash events"
{
  "explanation": "Pneumonia occurrence concerns respiratory infection, whereas skin rash events relate to dermatologic reactions -> clearly different",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
</example5>
