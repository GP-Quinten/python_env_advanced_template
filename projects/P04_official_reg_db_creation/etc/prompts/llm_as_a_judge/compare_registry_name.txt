You are provided with two strings representing the names of medical registries. Your task is to determine whether these two registry names refer to the same registry or to different registries. In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".
- "correct_answer": If final_decision is "same", provide the correct registry name. If final_decision is "different", provide a brief explanation of why they are different.

Instructions for giving the correct registry name when final_decision is "same":
- Provide the name in its most complete and correct form. This will later be embedded and used to find other occurrences of this registry name in the dataset.
- A registry name may be abbreviated or written in full. If both names refer to the same registry, provide the correct name in its full form + abbreviated form in parentheses.
- Don't hesitate to use your own knowledge to determine the correct registry name if it is not explicitly stated in the inputs.
- Sometimes the institution that own or built the registry is mentioned. Use this additional information to determine the correct registry name.
- When multiple or a combination of registries are mentioned, provide the correct registry name for each one separeted by a ' | ' character.
- When a an acronym is used, provide the full name of the acronym in parentheses after the acronym.
- Avoid useless words such as 'the', 'a', 'an', etc. in the registry name that could blur the signal of the registry name.
- When there is 'A' or 'An' before the registry name, or when there is '(not official name)' at the end of the registry name, it means that the registry name is not official or not clear enough. In this case, you may be more tolerant for differences in the registry names, as they may refer to the same registry but with different wording or abbreviations. However, if the differences are really too significant, you should still consider them as different registries.
- When the geographical area can be identified (mentioned in one of the names, or in your knowledge), include it in the registry name. For example, "National Cancer Registry" should be "National Cancer Registry (USA)" if the USA is mentioned in one of the names or if you know that the registry is from the USA. But don't confabulate (if the geographical area is not mentioned in the names and you don't know it, do not add it).
