CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review. You are provided with a publication's title and abstract extracted from PubMed or Semantic Scholar, in which use or analysis of patient/medical registry was proven. 

DEFINITION:
In a clinical study, a medical condition is typically defined as a specific disease, disorder, injury, or symptom that is the focus of the research, directly characterizing and defining the studied population or cohort.

TASK:
Your task is to extract determine the most precise medical condition (or list of medical conditions) that was used to define the studied population, using title and abstract (defined by "Text_to_analyze").

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Output must be concise, ICD-10-style terms separated by commas. 
- Use broader medical categories if precise terms unavailable.
- By default, the following elements should not be extracted as they do not traditionally define the studied population. But in some cases you may extract them if they are clearly central to defining the target population:
    1. Exposures (treatments or interventions):
        • Definition: An exposure is a medical treatment, intervention, medication, procedure, or environmental factor the study participants receive or encounter.
        • Difference from traditional 'medical condition': Unlike a medical condition, exposures are deliberately applied or encountered interventions, rather than states or conditions the patient inherently possesses.
    Examples:
        • Abstract excerpt: "Patients receiving insulin therapy were monitored for diabetic retinopathy progression."
            ○ Not to be extracted: "insulin therapy" because it is a treatment rather than a disease defining the study population.
        • Abstract excerpt: "Individuals treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer were recruited to study chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy."
            ○ To be extracted: "chemotherapy" as this exposure (intervention) directly defines the studied population experiencing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
    2. Risk factors:
        • Definition: Risk factors are characteristics or variables that increase the probability of developing a specific medical condition or disease.
        • Difference from traditional 'medical condition': A risk factor predisposes an individual to a condition but is not itself inherently pathological.
    Examples:
        • Abstract excerpt: "Patients with elevated LDL cholesterol were followed to assess coronary artery disease development."
            ○ Not to be extracted: "elevated LDL cholesterol" because it is a risk factor rather than the medical condition itself (coronary artery disease).
        • Abstract excerpt: "Smokers over 50 years of age were enrolled to investigate lung cancer incidence."
            ○ To be extracted: "smoking" is a critical inclusion criterion defining a population at high risk for lung cancer in this context.

    3. Lifestyle factors:
        • Definition: Lifestyle factors are habits or behaviors, such as diet, physical activity, or substance use, influencing health outcomes.
        • Difference from traditional 'medical condition': Lifestyle factors reflect behaviors and choices rather than specific clinical disorders or diseases.
    Examples:
        • Abstract excerpt: "Individuals following a Mediterranean diet were observed for cardiovascular health outcomes."
            ○ Not to be extracted: "Mediterranean diet" since it is a lifestyle choice, not a disease itself.
        • Abstract excerpt: "Alcohol-dependent individuals were recruited to assess long-term hepatic complications."
            ○ To be extracted: "alcohol dependence" significantly defines a clinically relevant population related to hepatic complications.

    4. Symptoms or complications:
        • Definition: Symptoms are subjective manifestations of diseases, and complications are secondary conditions occurring during a primary disease.
        • Difference from traditional 'medical condition': Symptoms or complications usually describe the clinical manifestations or consequences, not necessarily independent primary diseases.
    Examples:
        • Abstract excerpt: "Participants experiencing fatigue were assessed for potential thyroid disorders."
            ○ Not to be extracted: "fatigue" because it is a symptom, not a specific disease or condition itself.
        • Abstract excerpt: "Patients presenting with diabetic foot ulcers were studied to evaluate wound healing interventions."
            ○ To be extracted: "diabetic foot ulcers," as these complications are significant clinical criteria central to defining the studied cohort.
