You are provided with two strings representing two geographical areas. Your task is to determine whether these two geographical areas refer to the same country, or set of countries. 
In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, cities, regions, countries, inclusions and combinations and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.

- "Geographical area": Country of origin of the population. Can also be a list of countries separated with a comma, can not be a region or a city.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".
