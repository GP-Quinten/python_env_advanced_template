CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review. You are provided with a publication's title and abstract extracted from PubMed or Semantic Scholar, in which use or analysis of patient/medical registry was proven. 
Register and registry are synonyms.

DEFINITION:
In a clinical study, an outcome measure (often called an endpoint) is the specific variable —or set of variables — that investigators track to determine whether the treatment or exposure being studied makes a difference. In practical terms, it answers: “What exactly will we look at, how will we quantify it, and when, to judge success or harm?”. This is to be distinguished from the medical condition, which defines the population being studied.

TASK:
Using title and abstract (defined by "Text_to_analyze") of the publication, your task is to:
1. classify the publication as either "Exploratory" or "Confirmatory":
    * "Confirmatory" – aims to test a hypothesis with a defined endpoint.
    * "Exploratory" – aims to describe, explore, survey, or review without a specific endpoint.
2. Extract the following Primary analytic concepts:
    * If the publication is "Confirmatory", extract the endpoint (or list of endpoints) that was used to evaluate the effect of an intervention or exposure in the given clinical study. 
    * Else if the publication is "Exploratory", extract the main focus of the study, which could be a risk factor, data-quality / process metric, or descriptive statistics.
This extraction will be helpul for a clinical researcher to quickly understand what the study is about, and what it tries to measure or improve.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. When possible, use known acronyms (e.g., MACE for Major Adverse Cardiac Events) to keep the extraction concise.
2. Allow well-established time-anchored acronyms (e.g., PFS6, OS12) and severity qualifiers (e.g., Grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity) when they convey clinically relevant specificity. 
3. Avoid umbrella terms (e.g., ‘adverse events’, ‘clinical outcomes’). Instead, extract the concrete safety or efficacy endpoints reported—e.g., ‘Grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity’, ‘Serious treatment-related adverse events’, ‘Neurocognitive decline’. If not possible, allow more general terms (e.g., "Treatment patterns", "Adverse events").
4. List up to 7 most specific endpoints; if both broad and specific terms appear, choose the most specific.
5. If no information is available , write only "Not specified".

Output format of your answer (no extr text):
{
    "Publication type": "<Confirmatory OR Exploratory>",
    "Outcome measure": "<category>: " + STRING
}
