Context:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases that collect standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data on populations defined by diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. They support observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical-outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative studies, and linkage with other data sources. Administrative registries (e.g., hospital discharge, national cancer, stroke, chronic disease surveillance systems) qualify if they systematically collect patient-level data suitable for clinical or epidemiological analysis. Simple vital-statistics databases (birth/death) do NOT qualify.

Definitions
- Genuine patient registries: Systematic, standardized collection of patient-level data with enrollment and follow-up.
- Non-qualifying sources: Vital-statistics only, simple claims, administrative birth/death registries without longitudinal clinical detail.

Situation:
The publication that is given (title and abstract concatenated as Text_to_analyze) is registry related (it was manually checked), meaning that:
- a least one patient registry is mentioned in the text
- the publication/study uses or analyzes data from that registry

Task:
Given the publication’s title and abstract (as Text_to_analyze), extract the registry name (or list of registries separated by commas) by following the exact JSON output format.

Steps (in order):
1. Identify data sources
   - List all sources mentioned.
   - Label each as “qualifying registry” or “non-qualifying source.”
   - Confirm qualification against the definition above.
2. Assess usage
   - Determine if the study uses or analyzes a registry data (e.g., epidemiological outcomes, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, linkage, registry-based clinical trials).
   - Publications that only reference or recommend registries without data analysis do not qualify.
3. Extract registry name
   - If possible, extract the full name + acronym (in parentheses). You may use your personal knowledge to complete the name.
   - Try also identifying the geographical area of the patients from who the data is collected. It may be of use to you to determine the registry name.
   - If not clear official name is found, still extract a designation that is as accurate as possible (+country if available).
   - There may be multiple registries mentioned in the text. In this case, extract all of them (if they are clearly named), separated by commas. 
4. Output
   - Strict JSON, no extra text:
     {
       "step1_reflexion": "<reasoning about sources >", # (20 words maximum)
       "step2_reflexion": "<reasoning about data use>", # (20 words maximum)
       "step3_reflexion": "<reasoning about registry name extraction>", # (20 words maximum)
       "Registry name": "<name of the registry or registries, separated by commas if multiple>"
     }

Key Criteria for qualification for steps 1 and 2:
- Uses patient-level registry or qualifying administrative data.
- Performs epidemiological, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, or linkage analyses.
- Describes registry-based clinical trials.

Key Criteria for disqualification for steps 1 and 2
- Pure RCTs without registry involvement.
- Cohorts based only on institutional records without standardized registry protocols.
- Studies using vital-statistics only.
- Surveys or opinion pieces without actual registry data analysis.
- Publications merely recommending registries.

FINAL NOTES:
Output only the JSON. Do not add explanations.
