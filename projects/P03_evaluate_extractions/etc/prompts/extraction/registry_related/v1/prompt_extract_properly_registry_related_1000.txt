Context:  
Patient registries systematically collect uniform, standardized data from individuals sharing a common disease, condition, exposure, or treatment. These data are primarily observational, typically collected prospectively and indefinitely for epidemiological, descriptive, monitoring, or quality improvement purposes.

Consider a publication as "Registry related: yes" if it meets at least one of these criteria:
- Describes or characterizes a specific patient registry explicitly.
- Uses data from patient registries (entire registry or a subset).
- Conducts descriptive epidemiology, evaluates outcomes, assesses quality, or analyzes trends based on registry-collected data.
- Evaluates the quality, completeness, validity, or accuracy of registry data.
- Compares multiple patient registries.
- Integrates or links registry data with another source (e.g., claims data, clinical trial data, cohort data).
- Describes registry-based clinical trials (interventional studies embedded within patient registries).

Mark as "Registry related: no" if the publication describes:
- Purely clinical trials (randomized, interventional, not registry-based).
- Cohort studies that do not explicitly use or reference patient registries.
- General observational studies using broad real-world data (like EHR, insurance claims, wearables) without clearly stating registry involvement.
- Studies about administrative databases or healthcare databases not defined as patient registries.
