Context:
Patient registries are dedicated, systematic collections of uniform patient-level data on populations defined by specific diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments, primarily for observational purposes such as epidemiological analysis, monitoring, or quality assurance.

Classify a study as "Registry related: yes" only if it explicitly involves:
- Direct description or characterization of a patient registry.
- Analyses of patient registry data (complete or partial datasets).
- Evaluation of data quality, accuracy, or completeness of patient registries.
- Descriptive epidemiology, survival, outcomes, or trend analyses based on patient registry data.
- Comparative studies explicitly involving two or more patient registries.
- Linkage or integration of patient registry data with external data sources.
- Registry-based clinical trials or interventional registry studies.

Classify as "Registry related: no" if the study involves:
- Pure clinical trials unless explicitly registry-based.
- General longitudinal cohort studies without explicit registry involvement.
- Studies relying solely on administrative databases (hospital discharge, mortality registries, claims or pharmacy data) without systematic patient registry infrastructure.
- Cohorts or retrospective audits drawn only from hospital or clinic records without standardized registry collection.
- Studies using assessment tools/questionnaires developed by registries (such as CERAD cognitive test battery) but not involving actual registry data analysis.
- Clinician surveys or opinions recommending establishment of registries without using existing registry data.
- Publications recommending a registry or merely referencing the existence of registries in discussions/background sections without analysis of registry datasets.

Carefully differentiate between:
- Patient registries (structured systems with explicit protocols collecting clinical data).
- Administrative datasets (mortality databases, hospitalization data, insurance claims), which do not constitute patient registries even when linked to studies.

Given the Title+Abstract ("Text_to_analyze"), classify clearly and strictly using JSON format only:

{
    "Registry related": "yes" or "no"
