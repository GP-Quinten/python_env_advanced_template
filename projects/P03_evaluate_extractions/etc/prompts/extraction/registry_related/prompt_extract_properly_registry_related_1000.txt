Context:
A patient registry is a structured, systematic database designed to collect standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data on cohorts defined by specific diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. These registries enable observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical-outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative effectiveness studies, and linkage with other data sources (e.g., EHRs, claims, genetic databases). Administrative healthcare registries—operated by health systems, hospitals, or governments—also qualify when they systematically gather patient-level data for epidemiology or outcomes research. Examples include:
- Hospital discharge registries: e.g., Florida Agency for Health Care Administration discharge registry.
- National cancer registries: e.g., SEER Program (USA), Swedish Cancer Registry.
- Stroke registries: e.g., Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program.
- Chronic disease surveillance: e.g., Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System – Diabetes.

Exclusions:
Vital-statistics databases (birth/death certificates) and simple claims datasets without detailed longitudinal clinical variables are NOT considered registries for clinical or observational research.

Extraction Task:
Process the concatenated title + abstract provided as Text_to_analyze and execute three sequential steps. Do not skip or reorder them, and produce only the specified JSON output at the end—no commentary.

Step 1: Data-Source Identification
1. List every data source mentioned in the text.
2. Classify each as either a qualifying registry (meets our definition) or a non-qualifying source (e.g., vital-statistics only, simple claims, administrative birth/death records).
3. Confirm qualification by checking for standardized data collection, enrollment protocols, and longitudinal follow-up.

Common Pitfalls:
- Confusing “registry” in name only with genuine registries.
- Counting simple administrative lists (e.g., billing codes, vital statistics) as registries.

Step 2: Use-Case Evaluation
Determine whether the publication actually uses or analyzes the identified registry data.
Qualifying analyses include:
- Epidemiological outcomes (incidence, prevalence).
- Survival or time-to-event analyses.
- Descriptive summaries of clinical variables.
- Data-quality or completeness assessments.
- Comparative studies across registries or cohorts.
- Linkage studies with other datasets (e.g., trial data, EHRs, genetic databases).
- Registry-based clinical trials.

Non-qualifying mentions:
- Mere citation of a registry without data usage.
- Recommendations to establish or use a registry.
- Use of assessment tools, questionnaires, or clinical batteries developed by registries without analyzing registry data.
- Institutional cohort studies lacking standardized registry protocols.
- Surveys, opinion pieces, consensus statements.

Step 3: JSON Output
Produce a single JSON object, exactly in this form, with no additional keys or commentary:

{
  "step1_reflexion": "<brief reasoning: which sources and their classification>",
  "step2_reflexion": "<brief reasoning: how/if data were analyzed>",
  "Registry related": "yes" or "no"
}

- step1_reflexion: Summarize your identification and classification (e.g., “Identified SEER Program (qualifying) and national vital-statistics (non-qualifying).”).
- step2_reflexion: Summarize whether and how data were used (e.g., “Performed survival analysis on SEER data.”).
- Registry related: “yes” if explicit registry-data analysis; otherwise “no”.

Additional Guidance:
- Yes Example: Linking SEER & EHR to evaluate incidence → “yes”.
- No Example: RCT mentioning a registry in background → “no”.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not output any explanations beyond the JSON.
- Adhere strictly to the order and content of the JSON fields.
- Do not modify field names, casing, or structure.
