CONTEXT:
You are provided with two strings representing a population description used in a study, that were previously extracted from a publication's title and abstract following the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome).

TASK:
Your task is to determine whether these two terminologies refer to the same population descriptions or to different ones. 
In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, umbrella terms or close concepts, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.

DEFINITION:
- **Population description:** refers to the group of individuals or subjects that researchers target for inclusion in the study based on specific criteria. This group is chosen to represent the larger body of people to whom the results will be applicable.  

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

5 examples of answer:

<example1>
Population description 1: "Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) aged 40-80 years"
Population description 2: "COPD patients aged 40-80 years"
{
  "explanation": "Both descriptions refer to the same group of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) within the specified age range, indicating they refer to the same population -> same",
  "final_decision": "same"
}

<example2>
Population description 1: "Adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)"
Population description 2: "Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)"
{
  "explanation": "The first description refers to adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, while the second refers to individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Since these are two distinct types of diabetes -> different",
  "final_decision": "different"
}

<example3>
Population description 1: "Immunocompromised individuals with HIV infection"
Population description 2: "People living with HIV (PLWH)"
{
  "explanation": "While many PLWH are immunocompromised, not all are. The first group explicitly specifies immunocompromised status, which may imply advanced disease or CD4 threshold. Therefore, the first is a subset of the second -> different",
  "final_decision": "different"
}

<example4>
Population description 1: "Children undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia"
Population description 2: "Pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy"
{
  "explanation": "Both populations involve children receiving chemotherapy, but the first is limited to leukemia patients, while the second includes all pediatric cancers. Since the latter is broader, they may only partially overlap -> different",
  "final_decision": "different"
}

<example5>
Population description 1: "Obese adults with metabolic syndrome"
Population description 2: "Adults with obesity"
{
  "explanation": "Metabolic syndrome includes a cluster of conditions (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance), and not all obese adults meet its criteria. The first group is a narrower subgroup with specific metabolic complications -> different",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
