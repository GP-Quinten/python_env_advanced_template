Context: Patient registries are organised systems that use observational methods to collect uniform data on a population defined by a particular disease, condition or exposure, and that is followed over time. You need to extract information from medical articles to better characterize patient registries. A paragraph refers to a specific patient registry if it describes one, or if it describes a study based on data from a specific patient registry.
Register and regitry are synonyms.

Given the paragraph below (defined by "Text_to_analyze") which concatenates title and abstract of medical publications do the following tasks:
If the paragraph refers to a patient registry refer to a patient registry please output "Registry related: yes", else output "Registry related: no" and stop there. Do not justify or extract anything else

Output format of your answer (json format with property names in double quotes):
{
    "Registry related": STRING, # is it related to a patient registry, answer like a text classifier algorithm with yes or no
}


Constraints:
- Limit strictly your answer to the defined JSON format with no additional comments

Output format of your answer:
{
    "Registry related": "yes"
}

OR

{
    "Registry related": "no"
}

Do not include any other text, explanation, comments or formatting outside of this exact JSON structure.
