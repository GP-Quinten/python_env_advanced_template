CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review. You are provided with a publication's title and abstract extracted from PubMed or Semantic Scholar, in which use or analysis of patient/medical registry was proven.

DEFINITION:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases that collect standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data on populations defined by diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. They support observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical-outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative studies, and linkage with other data sources. Administrative registries (e.g., hospital discharge, national cancer, stroke, chronic disease surveillance systems) qualify if they systematically collect patient-level data suitable for clinical or epidemiological analysis. Simple vital-statistics databases (birth/death) do NOT qualify.
Register and registry are synonyms.

TASK:
Given the paragraph below (defined by "Text_to_analyze") which concatenates title and abstract of medical publications, do the following tasks:  
- Extract the name of the patient registry (or list of registries separated by commas) used in the study, or the name of the registry from which data is collected.
- Extract as accurately as possible the geographical area of the registry used in the study, or the geographical area of the patients from which data is collected.
- Classify the publication as either "Survey/Review", "Exploratory" or "Confirmatory"
- Extract medical condition(s) of the studied population.
- Extract the PICO. The PICO stands for Population description, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome measure. (Later defined)
- Extract sex of the studied population.
- Extract age group of the studied population.
- Extract the population size.
- Extract the Population follow-up duration.
- Classify the design model of the study performed in the paragraph.

EXTRA DEFINITIONS:
- Patient registry:
    * Qualifying source: Systematic, standardized collection of patient-level data with enrollment and follow-up.
    * Non-qualifying source: Vital-statistics only, simple claims, administrative birth/death registries without longitudinal clinical detail.
- Geographical area:
    * Most precise Geographical area of the patients from which data was collected to build the registry, and analyzed in the study.
- Publication type:
    * Survey/Review: A publication that gathers and summarizes existing knowledge, often without new data collection.
    * Exploratory: A publication that investigates new hypotheses or relationships, often with preliminary data.
    * Confirmatory: A publication that tests specific hypotheses with rigorous methods and data analysis.
- Medical Condition:
    * In a clinical study or its publication, a medical condition is typically defined as a specific disease, disorder, health-related state, or procedure (or even environmental/demographic/lifestyle factors) that is the focus of the research and directly characterizes/defines the studied population or cohort
- Population description: 
    * Refers to the group of individuals or subjects that researchers target for inclusion in the study based on specific criteria. This group is chosen to represent the larger body of people to whom the results will be applicable. The criteria for inclusion might include age, gender, medical condition or health status, and other demographic or medical characteristics that define who is eligible to participate in the trial. The population is essential for determining the relevance and applicability of the study's findings to the broader public or to specific subsets of patients.
- Intervention:
    * Refers to a specific treatment or set of actions administered to participants. This can include medication, surgical procedures, behavioral modifications, lifestyle changes, or other therapeutic strategies implemented to test their efficacy or effects on health outcomes. If several interventions, list all of them.
- Comparator:
    * a reference used to evaluate the impact of a condition or the effect of an intervention. When it exists, the comparator (or control) group has a different condition or intervention compared to the studied population. Researchers compare results from the control group with results from the experimental group to find and learn from any differences. If several comparators, list all of them.
- Outcome measure/Primary analytical concept:
    * (often called an endpoint) is the specific variable —or set of variables — that investigators track to determine whether the treatment or exposure being studied makes a difference. In practical terms, it answers: “What exactly will we look at, how will we quantify it, and when, to judge success or harm?”. This is to be distinguished from the medical condition, which defines the population being studied.
- Population sex:
    * Population sex of the population included. You are only strictly allowed to use classes among: "Male", "Female".
- Population age group:
    * Age of the population included. You are only strictly allowed to use classes among: "Child", "Adult", "Older Adult".
- Population size:
    * Size of the population considered in the study.
- Population follow-up: 
    * Duration of the study.
- Design model: Class of study. You are only strictly allowed to use one class among the 7 below:
    1. Randomized Control Trial (RCT): An experimental study where participants are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group to measure the effectiveness of interventions.
    2. Cohort studies: Observational studies that follow a group of people over time to determine how certain exposures affect specific outcomes.
    3. Case-control studies: Observational studies that compare individuals with a particular condition (cases) to those without (controls) to identify factors that may contribute to the condition.
    4. Case-only studies: Observational studies in which cases are the only subjects used to estimate or test hypotheses about effects.
    5. Cross-sectional studies: Observational studies that analyze data from a population at a single point in time.
    6. Cost studies: include all cost analyses (e.g., cost-effectiveness).
    7. Not found: If no category corresponds or not found.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
-----
- For all fields, use your personal knowledge when appropriate and when you are sure of the answer.
    * Example: "Bedside Estimation of Risk From Percutaneous Coronary Interventions: The New Mayo Clinic Risk Scores" --> Extract 'USA' as Geographical area because Mayo Clinic is a famous US organization

-----
- Registry name:
    * Steps (in order):
        1. Identify data sources:
            - List all sources mentioned. When a registry cannot be uniquely identified, add 'A' or 'An' before the source name to indicate it is an indefinite article.
                * Example: "A national cancer registry" or "An administrative database"
            - Label each as “qualifying registry” or “non-qualifying source.”
            - Confirm qualification against the definition above.
        2. Assess usage:
            - Determine if the study uses or analyzes a registry data (e.g., epidemiological outcomes, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, linkage, registry-based clinical trials).
            - Publications that only reference or recommend registries without data analysis do not qualify.
        3. Classify as "Registry Name is Official/Unique" "Yes" or "No":
            - If the registry name is clearly defined and official/Unique, classify it as "Registry Name is Official/Unique" "Yes".
            - If the registry name is not clearly defined or is an informal designation (other registries ould fit in this specific name/designation), classify it as Registry Name is Official/Unique" "No".
        4. Extract registry name
            - If possible, extract the full name + acronym (in parentheses). You may use your personal knowledge to complete the name.
            - Using the geographical area may be of use to you to determine the registry name.
            - If not clear official name is found, still extract a designation that is as accurate as possible (+country if available), adding 'A' or 'An' before the name to indicate it is an indefinite data source name. But it should still be clear that the found name is not an official name, by adding '(not official name)' at the end of the extracted name.
            - If the name is not an official one, If possible, put in parentheses the country + disease of interest of the registry, to help identify it.
                * Example: "A Trauma Registry (USA) (Ankle Fracture Registry) (not official name)"
                * Example: "A national cancer registry (not official name)"
            - There may be multiple registries mentioned in the text. In this case, extract all of them (if they are clearly named), separated by commas and following the same rules as above.

    * Key Criteria for qualification for steps 1 and 2:
        - Uses patient-level registry or qualifying administrative data.
        - Performs epidemiological, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, or linkage analyses.
        - Describes registry-based clinical trials.

    * Key Criteria for disqualification for steps 1 and 2
        - Pure RCTs without registry involvement.
        - Cohorts based only on institutional records without standardized registry protocols.
        - Studies using vital-statistics only.
        - Surveys or opinion pieces without actual registry data analysis.
        - Publications merely recommending registries.

-----
- Geographical area:
    * The geographical area is often mentioned in the registry name. 
        - Example: "The French Registry of Patients with Aortic Stenosis" --> Extract 'France' as Geographical area.
    * Determine the most precise location using the hierarchy below (if option 1 is not available/possible, use option 2, etc.):
    1. City (+ Country)
        * Example: "Paris, France"
    2. Region or State (+ Country)
        * Example: "California, USA"
    3. Country
        * Example: "USA"
    4. Multinational / Union of Countries (fewer than 5) (+ List of countries if less than 5)
        * Example: "Multinational - Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden)"
    5. International (More than 5 countries) (+ number of countries if available)
        * Example: "International - Europe"
    6. Worldwide (multiple continents)
        * Example: "Worldwide (5 continents)"
    --> If there is no information towards any of these 6 types of geographical area extractions, assign 'Not found'.

-----
- Medical condition:
    1. Most of the time, the medical condition will be specified in the title. Of course, it can also be specified in the abstract.
    2. Distinguish the medical condition from the risk factors, endpoint / outcome measure, main variables / descriptive statistics, and target/study population. 
        * Example: "Patients with Type 2 Diabetes were recruited to study the effects of Metformin on cardiovascular health." 
            - To be extracted: "Type 2 Diabetes" as it is the medical condition defining the study population.
            - Not to be extracted: "Metformin" as it is a treatment (exposure/intervention) rather than a medical condition.
    3. Most of the time, you will have only one medical condition to extract. But in some cases, you may have to extract a combincation of medical conditions with the following format.
        * Example: "Breast cancer + Diabetes mellitus type 2" 
    4. Output must be concise, ICD-10-style terms. Use Capitalization and commas to separate multiple conditions. 
    5. Use acronyms for famous medical conditions (e.g., COPD for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, CAD for Coronary Artery Disease) to make it easier for the user to read.
    6. use umbrella terms (+ details) to group close concepts as one medical condition.
        * Example 1: "Brain Tumors (astrocytoma, glioblastoma, meningioma)" instead of listing each tumor type separately.
        * Example 2: "Organ Transplantation (Liver)".
    7. The name of the database(s) / registry(ies) used in the study or in the survey can be a good clue to identify the medical condition, so you can use it in your extraction.

    EXAMPLES:
    1. EXAMPLE 1:
        * Abstract excerpt: "Patients receiving insulin therapy were monitored for diabetic retinopathy progression."
        GOOD: "Diabetes Mellitus (Insulin therapy -> Diabetic Retinopathy)"
        BAD: "Insulin therapy"
    2. EXAMPLE 2:
        * Abstract excerpt: "Individuals treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer were recruited to study chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy."
        GOOD: "Breast Cancer "
        BAD (Intervention instead of Medical condition): "Chemotherapy"
    3. EXAMPLE 3:
        * Abstract excerpt: "Patients with elevated LDL cholesterol were followed to assess coronary artery disease development."
        GOOD: "CAD"
        BAD (Risk factor instead of Medical condition): "Elevated LDL Cholesterol"
    4. EXAMPLE 4:
        * Abstract excerpt: "Smokers over 50 years of age were enrolled to investigate lung cancer incidence."
        GOOD: "Lung Cancer"
        BAD (Risk factor instead of Medical condition):"Smoking"
    5. EXAMPLE 5:
        * Abstract excerpt: "Individuals following a Mediterranean diet were observed for cardiovascular health outcomes."
        GOOD: "Cardiovascular Diseases"
        BAD (Lifestyle factor instead of Medical condition): "Mediterranean diet"
    6. EXAMPLE 6:
        * Abstract excerpt: "Alcohol-dependent individuals were recruited to assess long-term hepatic complications."
        GOOD: "Alcohol Dependence"
        * BAD (Lifestyle factor instead of Medical condition): "Alcohol consumption"


-----
- Outcome measure / Primary analytic concepts:
    * If the publication is "Confirmatory", extract the endpoint (or list of endpoints) that was used to evaluate the effect of an intervention or exposure in the given clinical study. 
    * Else if the publication is "Exploratory", extract the main focus of the study, which could be a risk factor, data-quality / process metric, or descriptive statistics.
    * Else if the publication is "Survey/Review", extract the main focus/takeaway of the survey or review, which could be a summary of existing knowledge, trends, or recommendations.
    1. Use umbrella terms (+ detailed) to group close concepts.
        * Example 1: 
            - BAD: "Exploratory: Pathology reports on tumour resection, Pathology reports on lymphadenectomy, Pathology reports on sentinel lymph nodes, Treatment patterns"
            - GOOD: "Exploratory: Data Quality Indicators QIs (Pathology reports (tumour resection, lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymp nodes)), Treatments patterns"
        * Example 2: 
            - BAD: Confirmatory: OS5, OS10, CSS5, CSS10, Tumor size 
            - GOOD: Confirmatory: OS (5y, 10y), CSS (5y, 10y), Tumor size
    3. Use synthetic + acronym clinical language to make it easier for the user to read. Imagine this will be in a small box on a website.
        * Incidende Rate -> IR
        * Overall Survival -> OS
        * Progression-Free Survival -> PFS  
        * Major Adverse Cardiac Events -> MACE
    4. List up to 3 Primary analytic concepts (the most important ones). You don't need to extract 3 every time.
        * Use umbrella terms (+ details) method to regroup key concepts as one Primary analytic concept.
    5. When possible, for each extracted primary analytic concept, indicate with nouns or adjectives if the studies looks at a static or dynamic measure, or a frequency (e.g., "Median OS", "IR evolution over 10 years", "Grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity at baseline", "Neurocognitive decline at 6 months", "Change in BMI over 2 years", "Risk of colorectal cancer recurrence within 5y").
    6. If no information is available , write only "Not found".
