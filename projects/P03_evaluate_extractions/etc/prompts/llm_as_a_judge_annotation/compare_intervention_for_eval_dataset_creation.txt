CONTEXT:
You are provided with two strings representing the names of medical interventions that were previously extracted from a publication's title and abstract following the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome).

TASK:
Your task is to determine whether these two terminologies refer to the same intervention or to different interventions. 
In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, umbrella terms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.

DEFINITION:
- **Intervention:** the treatment, procedure, diagnostic test, or exposure being evaluated. It is what researchers introduce or study to determine its effect on the population. Clearly defined interventions ensure precise comparisons, guide clinical decisions, and support focused research outcomes.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

5 examples of answer:
<example1>
Intervention 1: "Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)"
Intervention 2: "DAPT"
{
  "explanation": "The abbreviation 'DAPT' is used in both names -> same",
  "final_decision": "same"
}

<example2>
Intervention 1: "Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)"
Intervention 2: "Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)"
{
  "explanation": "The two interventions are different antiviral drugs used for treating chronic hepatitis B -> different",
  "final_decision": "different"
}

<example3>
Intervention 1: "Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)"
Intervention 2: "LABA monotherapy"
{
  "explanation": "The first intervention refers to a combination therapy of LABA and ICS, which is commonly used in the treatment of asthma or COPD. The second refers to LABA alone, without corticosteroids. These are clinically distinct, as LABA monotherapy may have different efficacy and safety profiles compared to combination therapy. Therefore, they are not the same intervention.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}

<example4>
# tricky example, where umbrella terms are used, thus not exactly the same, but still referring to the same intervention for the purpose of our work
Intervention 1: "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)"
Intervention 2: "Neuromodulation therapy"
{
  "explanation": "Both terms refer to interventions that involve altering brain activity, but 'Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)' is a specific type of neuromodulation therapy. Sufficiently similar to be considered the same intervention in this context.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}

<example5>
# other trickier example, where the intervention is not exactly the same, but still refers to the same intervention for the purpose of our work
Intervention 1: "Mediterranean dietary pattern"
Intervention 2: "Dietary interventions"
{
  "explanation": "Both terms refer to dietary approaches, but the first is a specific type of diet while the second is more general. However, the same type of intervention is being evaluated, thus they can be considered the same intervention in this context.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
Intervention 1: "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)"
Intervention 2: "Mindfulness meditation programs"
{
  "explanation": "Both terms refer to interventions that involve mindfulness practices, but MBSR is a specific structured program while the second is a broader category. However, they are sufficiently similar in their focus on mindfulness to be considered the same intervention in this context.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
