Context:
Patient registries are structured systems systematically collecting standardized data on individuals sharing specific characteristics (disease, condition, exposure, or treatment) over extended periods for epidemiological description, monitoring, outcomes analysis, or quality improvement.

Registry-related studies (classify as "yes") explicitly:
- Describe or characterize a patient registry.
- Analyze registry data (whole or partial).
- Evaluate registry data quality or completeness.
- Conduct descriptive epidemiology or outcomes/trend analyses based on registry data.
- Compare multiple registries.
- Link registry data with other data sources.
- Conduct registry-based clinical trials.

Non-registry studies (classify as "no"):
- Pure clinical trials (unless explicitly registry-based).
- General longitudinal cohort studies without registry data.
- Studies using only administrative databases (hospital, mortality, claims/prescription data) without patient registries.
- Cohorts/audits derived from hospital records.
- Studies merely using tests/questionnaires developed by registries (e.g., CERAD test battery).
- Surveys/opinion pieces recommending registries without actual registry data use.
