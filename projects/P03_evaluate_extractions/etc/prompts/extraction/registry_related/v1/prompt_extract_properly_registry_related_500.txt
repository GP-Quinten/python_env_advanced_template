Context: 
Patient registries are structured systems that collect uniform data systematically about patients sharing a specific disease, condition, exposure, or treatment. 
They typically have standardized data collection over an extended or indefinite period, primarily for observational purposes such as epidemiological description, disease surveillance, trend analysis, outcomes monitoring, or quality improvement.  
Registry-related publications include studies that:
- Describe a patient registry.
- Use data from patient registries (whole or partial).
- Perform descriptive epidemiology, trends, outcomes analysis, or quality assessment based on registry data.
- Evaluate registry data quality.
- Compare multiple registries.
- Link registry data with other data sources.
- Conduct registry-based clinical trials (interventional studies within registries).

Non-registry studies:
- Pure clinical trials (unless explicitly registry-based).
- General longitudinal cohort studies without mentioning registries.
- Studies using generic real-world data (EHR, claims, etc.) without clearly referencing registries.

Given the text below (Title + Abstract), classify it clearly:
- Output "Registry related: yes" if clearly linked to a patient registry.
- Otherwise, output "Registry related: no".

Answer strictly in JSON format:
{
    "Registry related": "yes" or "no"
}

Do not include any other text, explanation, comments or formatting outside of this exact JSON structure.
