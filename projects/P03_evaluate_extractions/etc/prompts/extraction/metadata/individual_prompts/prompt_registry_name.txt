Context:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases that collect standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data on populations defined by diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. They support observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical-outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative studies, and linkage with other data sources. Administrative registries (e.g., hospital discharge, national cancer, stroke, chronic disease surveillance systems) qualify if they systematically collect patient-level data suitable for clinical or epidemiological analysis. Simple vital-statistics databases (birth/death) do NOT qualify.

Definitions
- Genuine patient registries: Systematic, standardized collection of patient-level data with enrollment and follow-up.
- Non-qualifying sources: Vital-statistics only, simple claims, administrative birth/death registries without longitudinal clinical detail.

Situation:
The publication that is given (title and abstract concatenated as Text_to_analyze) is registry related (it was manually checked), meaning that:
- a least one patient registry is mentioned in the text
- the publication/study uses or analyzes data from that registry

Task:
Given the publication’s title and abstract (as Text_to_analyze), extract the registry name (or list of registries separated by commas) by following the exact JSON output format.

Steps (in order):
1. Identify data sources
   - List all sources mentioned. When a registry cannot be uniquely identified, add 'A' or 'An' before the source name to indicate it is an indefinite article.
      * Example: "A national cancer registry" or "An administrative database"
   - Label each as “qualifying registry” or “non-qualifying source.”
   - Confirm qualification against the definition above.
2. Assess usage
   - Determine if the study uses or analyzes a registry data (e.g., epidemiological outcomes, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, linkage, registry-based clinical trials).
   - Publications that only reference or recommend registries without data analysis do not qualify.
3. Classify as "Registry Name is Official/Unique" "Yes" or "No":
   - If the registry name is clearly defined and official/Unique, classify it as "Registry Name is Official/Unique" "Yes".
   - If the registry name is not clearly defined or is an informal designation (other registries ould fit in this specific name/designation), classify it as Registry Name is Official/Unique" "No".
4. Extract registry name
   - If possible, extract the full name + acronym (in parentheses). You may use your personal knowledge to complete the name.
   - Try also identifying the geographical area of the patients from who the data is collected. It may be of use to you to determine the registry name.
   - If not clear official name is found, still extract a designation that is as accurate as possible (+country if available), adding 'A' or 'An' before the name to indicate it is an indefinite data source name. But it should still be clear that the found name is not an official name, by adding '(not official name)' at the end of the extracted name.
   - If the name is note an official one, If possible, put in parentheses the country + disease of interest of the registry, to help identify it.
      * Example: "A Trauma Registry (USA) (Ankle Fracture Registry) (not official name)"
      * Example: "A national cancer registry (not official name)"
   - There may be multiple registries mentioned in the text. In this case, extract all of them (if they are clearly named), separated by commas and following the same rules as above.
4. Output foramat
   - Please provide your response in valid JSON format, no extra text or explanation, following this exact structure:
      {
         "Reflexions": {
            "step1_reflexion": "<reasoning about sources >", # (20 words maximum)
            "step2_reflexion": "<reasoning about data use>", # (20 words maximum)
            "step3_reflexion": "<reasoning about registry name extraction>" # (20 words maximum)
         }
         "Registry name is Official/Unique": "<Yes or No>", # it cannot be empty
         "Registry name": "<name of the registry or registries, separated by commas if multiple>"
      }

Key Criteria for qualification for steps 1 and 2:
- Uses patient-level registry or qualifying administrative data.
- Performs epidemiological, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, or linkage analyses.
- Describes registry-based clinical trials.

Key Criteria for disqualification for steps 1 and 2
- Pure RCTs without registry involvement.
- Cohorts based only on institutional records without standardized registry protocols.
- Studies using vital-statistics only.
- Surveys or opinion pieces without actual registry data analysis.
- National or regional surveys that are not registries
- Publications merely recommending registries.

FINAL NOTES:
Output only the JSON. Do not add explanations.
