CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review.
You are provided with two strings representing the terminologies of medical conditions previously extracted from a publication's title and abstract.

TASK:
Your task is to determine whether these two terminologies refer to the same medical condition or not.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, umbrella terms, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.
2. If at least one key concept is common to both strings, you should consider them as the same.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning. It should be synthetic and resums the key points that led you to your decision. Use acronyms to shorten your answer (20 words maximum)
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

Examples:
# Provide 5 examples for each additional instruction (3 same and 2 different)
Example 1:
Medical condition 1: "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)"
Medical condition 2: "COPD"
{
  "explanation": "The acronym 'COPD' is used in both strings, indicating they refer to the same medical condition.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
Example 2:
Medical condition 1: "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus + cardiovascular disease"
Medical condition 2: "Diabetes Mellitus type 2"
{
  "explanation": "Both strings refer to the same condition, just phrased differently, with 'Type 2' and 'type 2' being interchangeable.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
Example 3:
Medical condition 1: "Hypertension"
Medical condition 2: "High blood pressure"
{
  "explanation": "Second term is simply a broader term for hypertension, which is a common medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure.",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
Example 4:
Medical condition 1: "Asthma"
Medical condition 2: "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)"
{
  "explanation": "Asthma is a distinct respiratory condition, while COPD encompasses chronic bronchitis and emphysema; they are different conditions.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
Example 5:
Medical condition 1: "Breast cancer"
Medical condition 2: "Lung cancer"
{
  "explanation": "Breast cancer and lung cancer are two distinct types of cancer affecting different organs, hence they are different conditions.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}

Medical condition 1: "{{content_a}}"
Medical condition 2: "{{content_b}}"
