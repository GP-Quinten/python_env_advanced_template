Context: 
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases explicitly designed to collect standardized, longitudinal patient-level clinical data from populations defined by specific diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. They facilitate observational research, epidemiological monitoring, clinical outcomes evaluation, trend analyses, data-quality assessments, comparative studies, and linkage with other data sources. Registries involve standardized data collection protocols, systematic enrollment, and detailed follow-up.

Given the paragraph below (defined by "Text_to_analyze") which concatenates title and abstract of medical publications, do the following tasks:  
- Extract the name of the patient registry if it is given, if not, output "Not specified".  
- Extract as accurately as possible the geographical area of the registry used in the study, or the geographical area of the patients from which data is collected.

Additional instructions:
- For both fields, use your personal knowledge when appropriate and when you are sure of the answer.  
    * Example: "Bedside Estimation of Risk From Percutaneous Coronary Interventions: The New Mayo Clinic Risk Scores" ➔ Extract 'USA' as Geographical area because Mayo Clinic is a famous US organisation.  
- **Registry name.**  
    1. If possible, extract the full name + acronym. You may use your personal knowledge to complete the name.  
        - Example: "The French Registry of Patients with Aortic Stenosis" ➔ Extract 'French Registry of Patients with Aortic Stenosis (FRPAS)'.
    2. If the registry is not named, or the name is not clear enough to identify it, write "Not specified".
    3. There may be multiple registries mentioned in the text. In this case, extract all of them (if they are clearly named), separated by commas.
- **Geographical area.**  
     * The geographical area is often mentioned in the registry name. 
        - Example: "The French Registry of Patients with Aortic Stenosis" --> Extract 'France' as Geographical area.
    * To determine the most precise location, extract details in this order:
        1. City (+ Country)
            * Example: "Paris, France"
        2. Region or State (+ Country)
            * Example: "California, USA"
        3. Country
            * Example: "USA"
        4. Multinational / Union of Countries (fewer than 5) (+ List of countries if less than 5)
            * Example: "Multinational - Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden)"
        5. International (More than 5 countries) (+ number of countries if available)
            * Example: "International - Europe"
        6. Worldwide (multiple continents)
            * Example: "Worldwide (5 continents)"
        --> If there is no information towards any of these 6 types of geographical area extractions, assign 'Not specified'. 

Output format of your answer:  
{
    "Registry name": STRING,
    "Geographical area": STRING
}
Do not include any other text, explanation, comments or formatting outside of this exact JSON structure.

Constraints:  
- If information is not available, write only "Not specified".  
- Be synthetic; do **not** add anything beyond the JSON specified.
