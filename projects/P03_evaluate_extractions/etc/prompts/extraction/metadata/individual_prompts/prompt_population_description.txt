CONTEXT:
You are an expert of real-world clinical studies, especially at litterature review. You are provided with a publication's title and abstract extracted from PubMed or Semantic Scholar, in which use or analysis of patient/medical registry was proven. 
Register and registry are synonyms.

DEFINITIONS:
We are following the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) to extract key concepts from clinical studies. The definitions are as follows:
- **Population description:** refers to the group of individuals or subjects that researchers target for inclusion in the study based on specific criteria. This group is chosen to represent the larger body of people to whom the results will be applicable.  
- **Intervention:** the treatment, procedure, diagnostic test, or exposure being evaluated. It is what researchers introduce or study to determine its effect on the population. Clearly defined interventions ensure precise comparisons, guide clinical decisions, and support focused research outcomes. List all if several.  
- **Comparator:** The alternative intervention used for comparison in a study. It can be a placebo, standard treatment, usual care, or no treatment, helping researchers assess the effectiveness or superiority of the primary intervention. List all if several.
- **Outcome measure** (often called an endpoint) is the specific variable —or set of variables — that investigators track to determine whether the treatment or exposure being studied makes a difference. In practical terms, it answers: “What exactly will we look at, how will we quantify it, and when, to judge success or harm?”. This is to be distinguished from the medical condition, which defines the population being studied, and comparator.

TASK:
Extract the following fields from the publication's title and abstract (as Text_to_analyze):
- Population description
- Intervention
- Comparator
- Outcome measure
If no information is available for a field, write only "Not found".

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
These extractions will later be integrated in a database, then displayed in box on a screen of a website that will help clinicians explore registries and how they were used in previous studies. This goal will help them identify the right registry for their research or clinical needs.
The publication you are given can thus be of different types, such as observational studies, clinical trials, or reviews, as long as they involve the use of a patient registry. Thus some fields may not be applicable to all publications. In this case, first try to extract something that is still related to the field (as long as it is related to the field, and useful for clinicians), and if not applicable, write "Not found".

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use umbrella terms (+ detailed) to group close concepts. When they are too many to list (over 3), use a general term.
  - Example: "Intervention: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)" instead of listing each drug separately.
- Use synthetic + acronym clinical language to make it easier for the user to read. 
- You should avoid redundance in the extracted fields, such as repeating the same information in both "Population description" and "Outcome measure", or in "Intervention" and "Comparator". Because those 4 fields will be read one next to the other, they should be complementary and not redundant.
- COMPARATOR:
    * It is important to distinguish 'Placebo' from 'No treatment' and 'Standard of care': 
        - Placebo: An inactive substance given to control for psychological effects.
        - No treatment: Indicates the absence of any intervention.
        - Standard of care: Refers to the usual treatment provided to patients.
    * Use your personal knowledge to determine if the comparator is a placebo, no treatment, or standard of care. When in doubt, use "Not found".
    * When answer is 'Standard of care' or equivalent, you can try to specify in parentheses the 'standard of care' using your knowledge, or write "Not found" if you don't know/not sure. 

Output format of your answer:  
{
    "Population description": STRING,
    "Intervention": STRING,
    "Comparator": STRING,
    "Outcome measure": STRING

MAIN EXAMPLE:
-----------------
- BAD EXTRACTION:
{
    "Population description": "Older patients with traumatic brain injury",
    "Intervention": "Cranial CT scan",
    "Comparator": "Not found",
    "Outcome measure": "Mortality and morbidity"
}
Why BAD:
* Population description is too vague and doesn’t mention the registry or the specific age criterion (45+).
* Intervention misinterprets the role of cranial CT — it’s a diagnostic imaging modality, not the study's intervention. The actual "intervention" of interest was NSI (neurosurgical intervention).
* Comparator is missing; the study clearly involved a matched cohort comparison (NSI vs non-NSI).
* Outcome measure uses umbrella terms only ("mortality and morbidity") and omits key measurable endpoints (e.g., LOS, functional scores, discharge disposition).

- GOOD EXTRACTION:
{
    "Population description": "Patients aged ≥45 years with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) from a Regional Level 1 Trauma Center registry",
    "Intervention": "Neurosurgical intervention (NSI: craniotomy or craniectomy)",
    "Comparator": "Matched non-NSI controls (age- and ISS-matched)",
    "Outcome measure": "30-day mortality, in-hospital morbidity, functional outcome scores, and hospital length of stay (HLOS, ICULOS, SDLOS)"
}
Why GOOD:
* Population description is precise, including the age threshold, condition (severe TBI), and registry source — all essential for downstream registry utility.
* Intervention correctly identifies the actual medical intervention under investigation (NSI), clearly defined and abbreviated.
* Comparator uses appropriate clinical language and recognizes the matched cohort design, providing context.
* Outcome measure is comprehensive and specific, listing all key measured endpoints relevant to clinical outcomes (including mortality, morbidity, LOS, and function), avoiding vague terms like just “effectiveness.”

This GOOD version will be more informative and actionable for clinicians exploring how registries are used in TBI management.
