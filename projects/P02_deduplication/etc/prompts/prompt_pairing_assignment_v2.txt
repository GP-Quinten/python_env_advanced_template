You are provided with two strings representing the names of medical registries. Your task is to determine whether these two registry names refer to the same registry or to different registries. In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.
Medical registries are organized systems that use observational methods to collect uniform data on a population defined by a particular disease, condition, or exposure over time.

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning. No more than 30 words.
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

Key Elements to Consider to Determine if Two Registries are the Same:
- Country or region
- Medical field
- Disease studied
- Treatment studied
- Acronyms (to avoid confusion)

DECISION STRATEGY to use when there is an uncertainy due to inclusion-conflict (in pseudo_code):
At the begining of the explanation, when there is an uncertainty due to inclusion-conflict, you can use the following pseudo-code to decide the final decision:
- If you think Registry 1 and registry 2 have patients in common:
  - Start the 'explanation' with 'Inclusion-uncertainty'
  - If registry is a strict subset of patients of the other registry:
    - If you think than less than 50% of the patients in registry are in the other registry, and that they are significantly meaningful additional features in this registry compared to the other, then the final decision is "different", and explain why in the "explanation" field.
    - If you think than more than 50% of the patients in registry are in the other registry, then the final decision is "same", and explain why in the "explanation" field.
  - else If you think that registry 1 and registry 2 have a common subset of patients, but neither is a strict subset of the other, then the final decision is "different", and explain why in the "explanation" field.
