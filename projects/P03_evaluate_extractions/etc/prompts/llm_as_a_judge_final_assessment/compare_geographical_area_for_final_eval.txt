CONTEXT:
You are provided with two strings representing two geographical areas. 

TASK:
Your task is to determine whether these two geographical areas can be considered as the same or not.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS/DEFINITIONS:
- "Geographical area": Country of origin of the population. Can also be a list of countries separated with a comma.
- In making your decision, consider variations such as abbreviations, punctuation, minor wording differences, acronyms, cities, regions, countries, inclusions and combinations and differences in context that may indicate they refer to the same entity.
- If one string represents a city or region of a country, and the other string represents the country itself, you should consider them as referring to the same geographical area. 
- If string 1 is more precise than string 2 (list more entities than in string 2, or is more specific), then they are considered same geographical areas.
- If string 1 is less precise than string 2 (list less entities than in string 2, or is more general), then they are considered different geographical areas, unless they still conern the same country (then answer is 'same').

Output your answer as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "explanation": A brief explanation of your reasoning. (10 words max)
- "final_decision": Either "same" or "different".

<example1>
Geographical area 1: "Denmark"
Geographical area 2: "danemark"
{
  "explanation": "The term 'danemark'(string 2) is the French name for 'Denmark' (string 1)",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example1>

<example2>
Geographical area 1: "United States of America"
Geographical area 2: "USA"
{
  "explanation": "Using abbreviation 'USA' (string 2) for 'United States of America' (string 1)",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example2>

<example3>
Geographical area 1: "United Kingdom"
Geographical area 2: "Manchester"
{
  "explanation": "Manchester is a city within the United Kingdom. So the country is the same",
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example3>

<example4>
Geographical area 1: "Western Europe"
Geographical area 2: "United Kingdom, France"
{
  "explanation": "The first string specifies two countries, while the second string refers to a broader region that includes multiple countries, indicating they are different geographical areas.",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
</example4>

<example5>
Geographical area 1: "United States of America, Canada"
Geographical area 2: "North America"
{
  "explanation": "Final decision is 'same' because string N°1 is simply more precise than string N°2, which is a broader region that includes multiple countries.", 
  "final_decision": "same"
}
</example5>

<example6>
# exemple of different geographical areas because there are obvious differences in the context
Geographical area 1: "United States of America, Canada"
Geographical area 2: "South America"
{
  "explanation": "Obvious Different regions",
  "final_decision": "different"
}
