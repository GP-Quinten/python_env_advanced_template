Context:
Patient registries are structured, systematic databases collecting standardized, longitudinal, patient-level clinical data for groups defined by diseases, conditions, exposures, or treatments. Administrative registries (e.g., hospital discharge, national cancer, stroke, chronic disease surveillance systems) qualify when they systematically gather patient-level data suitable for epidemiologic or outcomes research. Simple vital-statistics databases (birth or death certificates) and generic claims datasets without longitudinal clinical detail do NOT qualify.

Task:
Given a publication’s title and abstract (as Text_to_analyze), determine if it is “registry related” by producing only the specified JSON.

Steps:
1. Identify Data Sources:
   - List all sources mentioned.
   - Classify each as “qualifying registry” or “non-qualifying source” based on standardized enrollment, follow-up, and patient-level clinical variables.

2. Assess Usage:
   - Confirm whether the publication uses or analyzes registry data (e.g., epidemiological outcomes, survival analyses, descriptive studies, data-quality assessments, comparative analyses, linkage studies, registry-based trials).
   - Mere mentions, background citations, recommendations, surveys, or use of registry-derived tools without analyzing registry data do NOT qualify.

3. Output:
Produce exactly this JSON, no extra keys or commentary:
{
  "step1_reflexion": "<reasoning about sources and classification>",
  "step2_reflexion": "<reasoning about data use>",
  "Registry related": "yes" or "no"
}

Criteria for “yes”:
- Explicit analysis of patient-level data from qualifying registries.
- Epidemiological, survival, descriptive, data-quality, comparative, linkage, or registry-based trial analyses.

Criteria for “no”:
- Pure RCTs without registry involvement.
- Institutional cohorts without standardized registries.
- Studies using only vital-statistics.
- Surveys or opinion pieces without registry-data analysis.
